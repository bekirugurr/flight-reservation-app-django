## Description 

In this project, I aimed to develope an application with the following features:
* Register, login, logout operations can be done.
* Admin users can see all flights, including previous and future ones. They can see flights with their reservation information. 
* Ordinary users can only see next flights from now on without reservation information. 
* While admin user can read, create, update or delete a flight, anonymous or authenticated user just can see flights
* Admin users can see all reservations. 
* Authenticated users can only see the reservations they have made 
* Authenticated users can create, update and delete reservations. (Both PUT and PATCH can be done)

## What is in the project?   

* Whole project was made by using <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94041207/182887053-c5c9c8cf-9182-48a6-aa02-800ee0e5e24f.png"  alt="django rest framework" height="30">
* In developoment process database is <img src="https://logos-download.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SQLite_Logo-450x193.png"  alt="sqlite" height="30">
* In production process database is <img src="https://icon-library.com/images/postgresql-icon/postgresql-icon-13.jpg"  alt="postgresql" height="30"> 
* Backend part was deployed to <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94041207/182912844-075185f7-3c3f-4d77-9f49-740dbdadd14d.png"  alt="heroku" height="30"> 
* **dj rest auth** package was used for login, logout and authentication. However register view and serializer were hard coded.
* **Concrete views** were used as views. 
* **Nested serializers** were used. 
* **Token authentication** was used for authentication.
* **Custom permissions** were used for authorization/permission. 
* **form validation** was done 
* **Swagger**, **redoc**, **debug toolbar** were used. And debug was made true for other users to check easily. 
* **Some methods were overridden** to create custom functionalities.

## If you want to check out the project with Postman (strongly advised üòé):

* For admin user **username: <u>admin</u>** and **password: <u>admin</u>**
* If you can use swagger use https://django-flight-reservation-api.herokuapp.com/swagger/
